# Clean up old files

Let's clean up our SSD since we no longer need the files from our previous Bitcoin Cash Node installation. 

> **Note:** This part is optional but recommended.

To remove those old files, open a new **Terminal** window and run the following command. Be sure to:
- Replace **/<SSD-directory/>** with the name of the SSD directory.
- Replace **/<old-version-number/>** with the version number of the previous Bitcoin Cash Node installation.

`sudo rm -R /<SSD-directory>/bitcoin-cash-node-<old-version-number>`

With the SSD organized, we can avoid confusion when updating Bitcoin Cash Node in the future.
