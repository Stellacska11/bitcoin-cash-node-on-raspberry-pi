# Preparation

Before upgrading Bitcoin Cash Node, we should back up our wallet (in the .dat file format) and update our device. This will help ensure a smooth transition to upgrading

## Back up our Bitcoin Cash wallet

1. In the **BCHN GUI**, click **File** and select **Back up wallet**. (0-1_file_backup.png)
2. Choose a directory where to save our wallet backup. (0-2_save_backup.png)

Our wallet will be saved in the directory we chose. We will be moving this wallet file to the newer version of Bitcoin Cash Node later, so remember where we saved this wallet backup file.

## Update your device

1. Close Bitcoin Cash Node.
	- **To close the application from the graphical user interface (GUI):** Click **File**, then choose **Exit**. (2-1_close_bchn_gui.png)
	- **To close the application from Terminal (if that is where you ran Bitcoin Cash Node):** Press **Ctrl + C** on the keyboard. (2-2_close_bchn_terminal.png)
2. Update and upgrade Ubuntu by doing one of the following:
    - Run the following command in Terminal.
